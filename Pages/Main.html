    <h2 class="chuck_text" >Carlos Ray "Chuck" Norris (born March 10, 1940) is an American martial artist and actor. <br>
                            He is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and judo. <br> After serving in the United States Air Force,
                            Norris won many martial arts championships and later founded his own discipline Chun Kuk Do. <br> Shortly after, in Hollywood,
                            Norris trained celebrities in martial arts. <br> Norris went on to appear in a minor role in the spy film The Wrecking Crew (1969). <br>
                            Friend and fellow martial artist Bruce Lee invited him to play one of the main villains in Way of the Dragon (1972). <br> While Norris continued acting,
                            friend and student Steve McQueen suggested him to take it seriously. <br> Norris took the starring role in the action film Breaker! Breaker! (1977), which turned a profit. <br>
                            His second lead Good Guys Wear Black (1978) became a hit, and he soon became a popular action film star. <br>
